## 🎯 About this repo

* The `microservices-demo-openshift` repo contains a modified version of the Sock Shop microservices application tailored for OpenShift. ([GitHub][1])
* It uses adjusted manifests so that you don’t need full cluster-admin privileges to deploy. ([GitHub][1])

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster (4.x or compatible) up and running.
* `oc` CLI installed and logged in with rights to create a project and deploy workloads.
* Internet access to pull required container images (or access to private registry if you build images manually).

---

## 🧭 Deployment Steps (CLI) — Using microservices-demo-openshift

```bash
# 1. Create a project/namespace for the demo
oc new-project sock-shop

# 2. Apply the full manifest (deploy all services)
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosuke5/microservices-demo-openshift/master/complete-demo.yaml
```

After apply, you will see deployments and services come up, e.g.:

```
deployment.extensions/carts-db created
service/carts-db created
deployment.extensions/carts created
service/carts created
...
```

([GitHub][1])

```bash
# 3. Expose the frontend service via OpenShift route
oc expose service front-end -n sock-shop

# 4. Confirm the route
oc get route -n sock-shop
```

You’ll get output like:

```
NAME         HOST/PORT                              PATH   SERVICES    PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
front-end    front-end-sock-shop.apps.<your-domain>        front-end   web          None
```

([GitHub][1])

Now you can open the hostname in your browser to access the Sock Shop UI.

## 🔄 (Optional) Build DB Images Locally

If you want custom database images (or need to build for a private registry), the repo README suggests building certain DB containers manually using S2I:

```bash
# Example (user-db)
cd docker/user-db-mongodb-container/
s2i build . centos/mongodb-34-centos7 <your-registry>/sockshop-user-db:latest

# Example (catalogue-db)
cd docker/catalogue-db-mysql-container/
s2i build . centos/mysql-57-centos7 <your-registry>/sockshop-catalogue-db:latest
```

Then update the `complete-demo.yaml` (or relevant deployment YAML) to refer to your rebuilt images. ([GitHub][1])

## 🧪 Verification & Cleanup

* **Check pods/services**

  ```bash
  oc get pods,svc -n sock-shop
  ```

* **Check logs** (e.g. frontend)

  ```bash
  oc logs deployment/front-end -n sock-shop
  ```

* **Remove everything**

  ```bash
  oc delete project sock-shop
  ```
