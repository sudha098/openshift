## 🚀 Deploying Applications — via OpenShift Web Console

OpenShift enables app deployment directly from the **Developer Perspective** without needing CLI commands.
Apps can be deployed from **Git repo, container image, Helm chart, devfile, or YAML**.

---

## 🔐 Login to Console

Access the console URL, for example:

```
https://console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster-domain>
```

Switch to **Developer Perspective** in the top-left dropdown.

Select / Create a **Project (Namespace)** where the application should deploy.

---

## 📌 Deployment Methods

Inside **Developer Perspective → +Add** you will see the common deployment choices:

| Deployment Type                    | Description                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **From Git**                       | Builds and deploys from a code repository                 |
| **Container Image**                | Runs an existing image (Docker/Quay/GHCR)                 |
| **Helm Chart**                     | Deploys packaged Kubernetes apps                          |
| **YAML**                           | Paste / upload manifest files                             |
| **Import YAML**                    | Provides editor for raw YAML                              |
| **Devfile / Builder Images (S2I)** | Automatic build + deploy (Java, NodeJS, Python, Go, etc.) |

---

## ▶️ Deployment from Git (Build + Deploy)

1. **+Add → From Git**
2. Enter your repository URL (HTTPS or SSH)
3. Select **Builder Image (S2I)** based on the language (NodeJS/Java/Python/Go/etc.)
4. Configure:

   * Application name
   * Deployment name
   * Resources (env vars, replicas, secrets)
5. Check **“Create a Route”** to expose the service publicly
6. Click **Create**

⏳ The build pipeline will:

* Clone repo
* Build container image (S2I)
* Push to internal registry
* Deploy the app as a Deployment + Service + Route

---

## 🚢 Deployment from Container Image

1. **+Add → Container Image**
2. Provide an image (public or private), e.g.:

   ```
   quay.io/org/app:latest
   docker.io/library/nginx:1.27
   image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/ns/app
   ```
3. Configure name, scaling, env variables, volumes, secrets
4. Enable **Create Route** to expose HTTP traffic
5. Click **Create**

📌 No build occurs — OpenShift pulls image and deploys immediately.

---

## 🧰 Deploy via Helm Chart

1. **+Add → Helm Chart**
2. Browse available charts (Official / Community / Operator-added)
3. Select a chart → **Install**
4. Configure chart parameters (YAML or form-based)
5. Deploy

⏳ Helm release will appear under:

```
Helm → Releases
```

---

## 🧾 Deploy using YAML

1. **+Add → Import YAML**
2. Paste Deployment / Service / Route / CRD YAML manifests
3. Click **Create**

✔ Best for Kubernetes-native workflows or exporting manifests from GitOps.

---

## 🌐 Exposing the Application (Route)

If not created at deployment time:

1. Go to: **Networking → Routes → Create Route**
2. Select the **Service**
3. Set:

   * Hostname (optional)
   * TLS (optional)
4. Create

Access app via:

```
https://<route-hostname>
```

## 🔍 Monitoring the Deployment

| View            | Purpose                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Topology**    | Visual connection graph of app + pods + services |
| **Pods**        | Logs, restart count, events                      |
| **Deployments** | Status, replicas, rollout, env vars              |
| **Events**      | View errors and cluster messages                 |
| **Metrics**     | CPU / Memory usage (if monitoring enabled)       |

📌 To restart rollout:

```
Workloads → Deployment → Actions → Rollout → Restart
```

---

## ⚙️ Scaling the App

1. Go to **Workloads → Deployment**
2. Edit the replica count OR use the **+ / -** buttons in Topology view

Auto-scaling (HPA) can be configured via:

```
Actions → Add Autoscaler
```

---

## 🔑 Using Secrets & ConfigMaps

To mount sensitive or config data:

1. **+Add → Secret / ConfigMap**
2. Go to **Workloads → Deployment → Actions → Edit**
3. Mount as:

   * Environment variables
   * Volume files
   * Key/value mappings

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (Delete)

To remove an app completely:

1. On **Topology view**, select the deployment group
2. Click **Actions → Delete Application**
3. Choose to delete all related resources (Deployment, Service, Route, HPA, PVC etc.)

| Deployment Method | Build Stage | Complexity  | Best Use Case                  |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| From Git (S2I)    | Yes         | Easy        | CI/CD + build apps from source |
| Container Image   | No          | Very Easy   | Deploy prebuilt images         |
| Helm Chart        | No          | Medium      | Full packaged deployments      |
| YAML              | No          | For experts | GitOps + Infra-as-Code         |
